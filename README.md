# The Deck Builder

The Deck Builder is a tool anyone can use to aid them in building a simple Pokemon deck. You can search for all cards, from pokemon to energy, by name.

# The Deck Builder Instructions

When searching for pokemon using The Deck Builder you will see all cards matching the name you searched for (ie "mew" or "Charizard" or "PHYSCIC") drop down after pressing submit. From there you press the (+) button to add the card to a set of a maximum of 60 at the bottom of the screen. If you want to remove a card, press the "x" button and it will go away. Don't worry about accidentaly going over the 60 card limit of a standard Pokemon deck either as this builder won't allow it.

# How to use The Deck Builder
